**Automatic Comparative Machine Learning Based on GLCM for Multiclass Classification**

<p align="justify">AutoCML based on GLCM is an artificial intelligence technique that is used to perform multiclass classification of images into different categories. GLCM is a statistical method that analyzes the distribution of pixel values in an image and provides valuable information about its texture patterns. When using AutoCML based on GLCM, automated machine learning algorithms are utilized to identify relevant texture features from the GLCM matrix and classify images with comparative perspectives. In the multiclass classification using AutoCML based on GLCM, the image is first converted to grayscale format, and a GLCM matrix is generated based on the pixel values and directions. A feature selection algorithm is then employed to identify the most relevant texture features from the GLCM matrix. Finally, an automated machine learning algorithm is used to classify the images into distinct categories based on the selected features. AutoCML based on GLCM has several advantages over traditional machine learning techniques, as it automates the feature selection process, reducing the need for hand-crafted intervention, and managing time and effort. Recent surveys have proved the effectiveness of this technique in various applications, such as in a study by Li et al. (2020), where it was used to classify different types of skin lesions from dermoscopy images with high accuracy. This technique can aid in the identification of skin diseases and the classification of skin lesions into different categories, making it a valuable tool for dermatologists. In another study by Chen et al. (2021), AutoCML based on GLCM was used to classify different types of breast lesions from mammography images, accurately differentiating between malignant and benign breast lesions, and aiding in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.</p>
